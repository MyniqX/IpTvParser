# IpTvParser

While I want to gain experience with WPF, I try to build something. This time, I chose IPTV because when I use it, I can't easily find the things I want. Simply put, the app parses M3U data and categorizes them based on their name and URL. If the name contains something like S1E1, it categorizes it as a TV show. If there is no file extension in the URL, it is considered a live stream, and the rest are categorized as videos. So far, it works, and it also has download capabilities.
